### Good morning, it is. 😸<br>
Hi there 👋 I'm Aksal. I'm a software engineer from 🇮🇩 Indonesia working to solve problems, but sometimes also create them.<br>
<br>
My code is like a girl (perfect and beautiful) so I'm always found that only me who can understand her. Wkwk, just kidding.<br>
<br>
Mostly I code in Javascript (React, Vue) and PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter). I'm also a big fan of Windows until I met Linux 😆.<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you!<br>

💡 Tip: Even though the morning air is good, it is better to not open your Windows.<br>
