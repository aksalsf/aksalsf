### Good morning, it is. ðŸ˜¸<br>
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aksal. I'm a software engineer from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesia working to solve problems, but sometimes also create them.<br>
<br>
My code is like a girl (perfect and beautiful) so I'm always found that only me who can understand her. Wkwk, just kidding.<br>
<br>
Mostly I code in Javascript (React, Vue) and PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter). I'm also a big fan of Windows until I met Linux ðŸ˜†.<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you!<br>
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Even though the morning air is good, but it is better to not open your windows.<br>
