### Happy weekend 🥰
Heya 👋 I'm Aksal. I'm a software engineer from 🇮🇩 Indonesia.

My code is like a girl (perfect and beautiful), so, I'm always found that only me who can understand her. Wkwk, just kidding.

Mostly I code in Javascript (React, Vue, TypeScript) and PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter). A Windows fanboy until I met Linux 😆
### Hey there, down here 👋 Want to read something cool?

<em>&quot;I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned to my dad and asked him,&quot;Do you know how many people are here right now&quot;? He said probably fifty thousand, since the stadium was full. I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was, I don't know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that night, I realized it wasn't true. All the stuff we did during class that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing special about my school at all.&quot;</em> <br>
