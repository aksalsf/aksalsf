### Happy weekend ðŸ¥°
Heya ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aksal. I'm a software engineer from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesia.

My code is like a girl (perfect and beautiful), so, I'm always found that only me who can understand her. Wkwk, just kidding.

Mostly I code in Javascript (React, Vue, TypeScript) and PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter). A Windows fanboy until I met Linux ðŸ˜†
### I'm also writing some stories on Medium

<em>&quot;The days I spent with you were a lot of fun. I realized for the first time that it makes me so happy to be needed by others. I thought I'd get along well with you like this. But I can't. I was being a jerk. While I was with you, I was looking at someone else. I kept it to myself even after realizing that. I was taking advantage of your kindness.&quot;</em> <br>
