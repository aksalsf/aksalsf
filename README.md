### Good morning, it is. ðŸ˜¸<br>
Hello, I'm Aksal. I am a software engineer from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. I solve problems, but sometimes I also create them. I love code until only me who can understand her. Mostly I code in Javascript (React, Vue) and PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter). I am also a big fan of Windows until I met Linux ðŸ˜†.<br>
Nice to meet you!<br>

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Even though the morning air is good, but it is better to not open your windows.<br>
